# Registering certificate bundles in Node\.js<a name="node-registering-certs"></a>

The default trust stores for Node\.js include the certificates needed to access AWS services\. In some cases, it might be preferable to include only a specific set of certificates\.

In this example, a specific certificate on disk is used to create an ` https.Agent` that rejects connections unless the designated certificate is provided\. The newly created `https.Agent` is then used by the DynamoDB client\.

```
import { DynamoDBClient } from '@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb';
import { NodeHttpHandler } from '@aws-sdk/node-http-handler';
import { Agent } from 'https';
import { readFileSync } from 'fs';
const certs = [readFileSync("/path/to/cert.pem")];
const agent = new Agent({
  rejectUnauthorized: true,
  ca: certs
});
const dynamodbClient = new DynamoDBClient({
  requestHandler: new NodeHttpHandler({
    httpAgent: agent,
    httpsAgent: agent
  })
});
```
