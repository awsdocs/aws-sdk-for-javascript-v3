# Migrating your code to SDK for JavaScript V3<a name="migrating-to-v3"></a>

There are a number of migration paths to the SDK for JavaScript version 3 \(V3\)\. To take full advantage of the reduction in capacity potential of V3, we recommend using path 3\.

------
#### [ Path 1 ]

Perform minimal changes:
+ Install only the specific AWS Service packages you need\.
+ Create and use V3 service clients, replacing the use of any global configuration values, such as Region, with configuration values passed in as arguments to the client\.

------
#### [ Path 2 ]

Follow path 1 and remove `.promise`, which are not required in V3\.

------
#### [ Path 3 ]

Follow path 1 and use the async/await programming model\.

------

The following sections describe these paths in detail, with examples\.

## Path 1 example<a name="path1-examples"></a>

The following code installs the AWS Service package for Amazon S3\. 

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3
```

The following code loads the Amazon S3 service\.

```
const {S3} = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');
```

**Note**  
To use this approach you must import the full AWS Service packages, `S3` in this case, and not just the service clients\.

The following code creates an Amazon S3 service object in the `us-west-2` Region\.

```
const s3 = new S3({region: 'us-west-2'});
```

The following code creates and Amazon S3 bucket using a callback function, using the following syntax from V2\.

```
client.command(parameters)
```

```
const {S3} = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');
const s3 = new S3({region: 'us-west-2'});
var bucketParams = {
    Bucket : BUCKET_NAME
};
function run(){
         s3.createBucket(bucketParams, function(err, data) {
         if (err) {
         console.log("Error", err);
         } else {
         console.log("Success", data.Location);
         }
    })
};
```

## Path 2 example<a name="path2-examples"></a>

Here is a function call in V2 using a `promise`\.

```
const data = await v2client.command(params).promise();
```

Here is the V3 version\.

```
const data = await v2client.command(params);
```

## Path 3 examples<a name="path3-examples"></a>

The following command installs the AWS Service package for Amazon S3\.

```
npm install @aws-sdk/client-s3; 
```

The following code loads only the Amazon S3 client, reducing the overhead\.

```
const {S3Client, CreateBucketCommand} = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');
```

 If you install only the client of a package, you must also import the V3 commands you want to use\. In this case, the code imports the `CreateBucketCommand`, which enables you to create and Amazon S3 bucket\. You can browse the available commands in your project's `node-modules/@aws-sdk/client-PACKAGE_NAME/commands` folder\. 

The following code creates an Amazon S3 service client object in the `us-west-2` Region\. 

```
const s3 = new S3Client({region: 'us-west-2'});
```

To call imported commands the recommended async/await pattern, you must import the commands you want to use, and use the following syntax to run the command\.

```
  CLIENT.send(newXXXCommand)
```

The following example creates an Amazon S3 bucket using the async/await pattern, using only the client of the Amazon S3 service package to reduce overhead\.

```
const {S3Client, CreateBucketCommand} = require('@aws-sdk/client-s3');
const s3 = new S3Client({region: 'us-west-2'});
var bucketParams = {
    Bucket : BUCKET_NAME
};
async function run() => {
      try {
           const data = await s3.send(new CreateBucketCommand(bucketParams));
           console.log("Success", data);
      } 
      catch (err) {
           console.log("Error", err);
      }
};
run();
```
