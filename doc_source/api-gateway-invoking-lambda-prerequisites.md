This topic is part of a tutorial that demonstrates how to invoke a Lambda function through Amazon API Gateway using the AWS SDK for JavaScript\. To start at the beginning of the tutorial, see [Invoking Lambda with API Gateway](api-gateway-invoking-lambda-example.md)\.

To set up and run this example, you must first complete these tasks:
+ Set up the project environment to run these Node TypeScript examples, and install the required AWS SDK for JavaScript and third\-party modules\. Follow the instructions on[ GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/javascriptv3/example_code/cross-services/lambda-api-gateway/README.md)\.
**Note**  
The AWS SDK for JavaScript \(V3\) is written in TypeScript, so for consistency these examples are presented in TypeScript\. TypeScript extends JavaScript, so these examples can also be run in JavaScript\. For more information, see [this article](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/developer/first-class-typescript-support-in-modular-aws-sdk-for-javascript/) in the AWS Developer Blog\.
+ Create a shared configurations file with your user credentials\. For more information about providing a credentials JSON file, see [Loading credentials in Node\.js from the shared credentials file](loading-node-credentials-shared.md)\.
