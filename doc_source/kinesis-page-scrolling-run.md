This topic is part of an example that demonstrates how to capture and process browser event data with Amazon Kinesis\. To start at the beginning of the example, see [Capturing Webpage Scroll Progress with Amazon Kinesis](kinesis-examples-capturing-page-scrolling.md)\.

Open the `blog_page.html` in your browser\. Adjust the size of the browser window until scroll\-bars display around the text\. When you scroll the scroll\-bars, the event data is captured in Kinesis\. To view the recorded data, open the stream in the Amazon Command Console, choose the **Monitoring** tab, and examine the information on the **Stream metrics** pane\.
