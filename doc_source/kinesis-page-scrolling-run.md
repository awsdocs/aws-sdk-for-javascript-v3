This topic is part of an example that demonstrates how to capture and process browser event data with Amazon Kinesis\. To start at the beginning of the example, see [Capturing Webpage Scroll Progress with Amazon Kinesis](kinesis-examples-capturing-page-scrolling.md)\.

Open the `blog_page.html` in your browser\. Adjust the size of the browser window until scroll\-bars display around the text\.
