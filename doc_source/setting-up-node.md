# Setting up an AWS Node\.js environment<a name="setting-up-node"></a>

To set up an AWS Node\.js environment in which you can run your application, use any of the following methods:
+ Choose an Amazon Machine Image \(AMI\) with Node\.js preinstalled\. Then create an Amazon EC2 instance using that AMI\. When creating your Amazon EC2 instance, choose your AMI from the AWS Marketplace\. Search the AWS Marketplace for Node\.js and choose an AMI option that includes a preinstalled version of Node\.js \(32\-bit or 64\-bit\)\.
+ Create an Amazon EC2 instance and install Node\.js on it\. For more information about how to install Node\.js on an Amazon Linux instance, see [Tutorial: Setting up Node\.js on an Amazon EC2 instance](setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.md)\.
+ Create a serverless environment using AWS Lambda to run Node\.js as a Lambda function\. For more information about using Node\.js within a Lambda function, see [Programming model \(Node\.js\)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/programming-model.html) in the *AWS Lambda Developer Guide*\.
+ Deploy your Node\.js application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk\. For more information about using Node\.js with Elastic Beanstalk, see [Deploying Node\.js applications to AWS Elastic Beanstalk](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/create_deploy_nodejs.html) in the *AWS Elastic Beanstalk Developer Guide*\. 
+ Create a Node\.js application server using AWS OpsWorks\. For more information about using Node\.js with AWS OpsWorks, see [Creating your first Node\.js stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opsworks/latest/userguide/gettingstarted-node.html) in the *AWS OpsWorks User Guide*\.
