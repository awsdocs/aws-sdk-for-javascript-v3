# Prerequisites<a name="messaging-app-prerequisites"></a>

This topic is part of a tutorial that create an AWS application that sends and retrieves messages by using the AWS SDK for JavaScript and Amazon Simple Queue Service \(Amazon SQS\)\. To start at the beginning of the tutorial, see [Creating an example messaging application](messaging-app.md)\.

To set up and run this example, you must first complete these tasks:
+ Set up the project environment to run these Node TypeScript examples, and install the required AWS SDK for JavaScript and third\-party modules\. Follow the instructions on[ GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/javascriptv3/example_code/cross-services/message-app/README.md)\.
+ Create a shared configurations file with your user credentials\. For more information about providing a credentials JSON file, see [Loading credentials in Node\.js from the shared credentials file](loading-node-credentials-shared.md)\.

**Important**  
This example uses ECMAScript6 \(ES6\)\. This requires Node\.js version 13\.x or higher\. To download and install the latest version of Node\.js, see [Node\.js downloads\.](https://nodejs.org/en/download)\.  
However, if you prefer to use CommonJS syntax, please refer to [JavaScript ES6/CommonJS syntax](sdk-example-javascript-syntax.md)
