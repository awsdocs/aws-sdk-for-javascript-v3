# Delete the resources<a name="kinesis-page-scrolling-destroy"></a>

This topic is part of a example that demonstrates how to capture and process browser event data with Amazon Kinesis\. To start at the beginning of the example, see [Capturing Webpage Scroll Progress with Amazon Kinesis](kinesis-examples-capturing-page-scrolling.md)\.

When you finish the example, you should delete the resources so you do not incur any unnecessary charges\. You can do this by following either [Deleting a stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-deleting-stack.html) in the AWS Management Console or the [Deleting a stack](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-cli-deleting-stack.html) in the command line\.
